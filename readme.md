# users-api-server
Test api server using the json-server npm package.

Service is available through https://my-json-server.typicode.com/ArtemBaranovsky/users-api-server/users



Note: To deploy the json-server live as we have seen, you actually only need db.json file in your project. There is no need of installing the json-server npm package locally inside the package.json file.
We installed it locally so we can test our API locally before making it live.
